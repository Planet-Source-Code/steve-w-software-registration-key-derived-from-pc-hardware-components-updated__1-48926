### Description

This is a simplified example that shows how to register an app to individual PCs using a key that is derived from unique properties such as the CPU ID, OS serial, MAC address etc.

It's real easy to do & secure enough to keep most users honest. Feel free to modify & use it as you see fit & please vote if you find it useful. Any feedback or comments are welcome and why not take up my cracking challenge - no one has succeeded yet!

It uses WMI so if you're running W95, W98 or NT4 & you get an automation error download the WMI engine from: http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/wmicore/1.5/W9XNT4/EN-US/wmicore.EXE.

Update info: The app is even more secure as it now includes complete obfuscation of the key variable and a simple and easily expandable anti-hacking routine (currently includes RegMon, FileMon, SoftICE - routine is adapted from Kevin Lingofelter's code at http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=10000&lngWId=1).
